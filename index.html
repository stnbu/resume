				    <p>VMware’s hybrid cloud platform group has a complex, mostly-Python, long-used test framework called “Goat”. My role
					at VMware was to maintain and extend this framework, along with participation in development of related quality
					infrastructure and tools (e.g. GitLab). Since this product line is available for a wide range of “cloud providers”
					(AWS, Rackspace, IBM, and more) as well as custom-built bare metal solutions; accordingly, the range of technologies
					involved was broad and rapid ramp-up was often required. A typical day might have included: feature implementation,
					bug resolution, assisting test authors in using framework features, build-out of ancillary tools, CI/CD pipeline
					features, git hooks, conception and realization of various web portals and custom tools, documentation, meetings and
					more.</p>

				    <p>Along with this came participation in design meetings, Agile meetings, daily stand-up meetings, technical
					assistance of colleagues and various other in-person interactions to coordinate.</p>

				    <p>Solutions and technologies used include: Python, most of its standard libraries, along with a wide range of 3rd
					party libraries: Django, Flask, Paramiko, Selenium-Python, NumPy and many others; Ruby, including GitLab
					customizations and extension of existing Ruby infrastructure; Fast, centralized logging via PostgreSQL, Rsyslog and
					Nginx, combined with a custom Python web UI for centralized logging (Flask).</p>

				    <p>Cisco was in need of a robust test framework for their UCS product line. I started in late 2012 on a project that
					would become known as “Qali”, a pure-Python testing framework that would ultimately become the standard testing
					framework for the entire business unit, and still is to this day. Qali models the state of the UCS in-memory, using a
					combination of 1) reading build-related meta information to understand the products’ structure, including possible
					hardware and configuration combinations and 2) querying the device itself at test-execution-time to understand its
					state and populate the model. With this information, test authors are able to write very high-level, readable tests
					describing the desired end-state or the sequence of state changes needed to execute the test in a nice, intuitive,
					“object oriented” Python syntax reflecting the hierarchical structure of the product’s configuration.</p>

				    <p>My involvement with Qali and associated projects went from early design and PoC to maintenance and architectural
					oversight of the entire project years later, after adoption by many hundreds of users spanning several
					departments.</p>

				    IT Manager

			    </div>


			    <div class="job-body">
				<ul>
				    <li>Hired as company's first IT engineer; lead effort of ground-up redesign and overhaul of entire network and infrastructure, realized substantial gain in resource use efficiency and reliability</li>
				    <li>Realized large performance gains for ASIC design resources (circuit simulation, server-sided design environment) by consolidating and pooling existing resources and creating custom Python utility web portals, dashboard for interaction, administration (Flask)</li>
				    <li>Deployed internet-facing corporate firewall, VPN endpoint using Linux IPtables, OpenVPN and various intrusion prevention, detection measures (100% open source software)</li>

				<button class="collapsible">more...</button>
				<div class="job-more">
				    <p>The infrastructure required to effectively operate a 100+ person team of mixed-signal ASIC design and testing staff
					is considerable. Outages, performance issues and other problems become very expensive very quickly. The top-to-bottom
					administration of this environment was my responsibility at Triad Semiconductor. At the time of my hiring, there were
					numerous problems and inefficiencies that a busy team of design engineers don’t have the time or resources to attend
					to. I was able to very quickly resolve many of these, leveraging Linux and OSS, a solution not practical without the
					required domain knowledge.</p>

				    <p>All of this worked out nicely, and much of it is still in place now. As good example, when I was hired, multiple
					bare-metal Red Hat Linux servers were in use for circuit simulation (predominately via Mentor Graphics). There was no
					reasonable way for engineers to reliably understand current and near-term capacity on these hosts. As a result, it was
					common for hosts to slow to a crawl due to over-use. I resolved this by consolidating these hosts into a common
					cluster, one of which was used for storage. I exported this same filesystem over a fast, dedicated network, bonding
					multiple 10GbE interfaces on each host, deployed Puppet for centralized administration and created a web based (Flask)
					UI that allowed engineers to see at a glance what utilization was, know what jobs are queued and more effectively
					anticipate utilization. This amounted to much more efficient use of existing resources. It wasn’t perfect, but was
					well on its way to being about the best allocation/utilization possible of the available hardware without the need for
					expensive, proprietary solutions. This is representative of the many other projects that I was involved with, from
					conception to implementation.</p>

				    <p>Some of the other especially fruitful solutions implemented by me include: A fully OSS VPN, using OpenVPN with a
					custom PKI, allowing for centralized certificate and endpoint management; Replacing costly, proprietary Linux
					distribution with free, easily maintained Debian variants (mostly Ubuntu); Replacing an expensive, slow, low capacity
					tape backup system with a centralized over-network, differential, high capacity backup system using hot-swappable
					commodity eSATA hard disks; Comprehensive site monitoring, including, backup job results, power status, equipment
					temperatures and humidity using Nagios, Puppet and some custom glue logic; Consolidation and smarter resource
					utilization using host virtualization (Xen ~ v3.0 at the time).</p>

				<div class="job-more">

				    <p>Greatwall Systems was another Wake Forest University spin-off involving many of the same personnel as PointDx. This
					time I was employee number four. As an information security start-up, Greatwall Systems had special security
					requirements with regard to both their corporate network and the test network used for product development.</p>

				    <p>As the sole Systems Administrator, both of these responsibilities laid with me. All routing, intrusion
					detection/prevention, email categorization (spam detection), VPN and firewalling systems were implemented using Debian
					Linux running on commodity hardware. The development environment, along with various issue tracking and source version
					control systems were implemented using a heavily customized instance of Trac. Subversion (and later Git, with a
					transparent migration and no data loss) were employed for version control. As a start-up with a tight budget, all of
					this was accomplished using fully open-sourced software, deployed, customized and maintained by myself.</p>

				    <p>Again, facing budget constraints and a desire to be as efficient and cost-aware as possible, numerous other
					projects and responsibilities fell to me. Some of the more interesting ones include: Installing Linux on and adding
					second network interface support for the Sony PlayStation 3 (PS3) for the purposes of developing support for the Cell
					architecture; A complete IP-telephony system using commodity hardware running Asterisk and later FreeSwitch, driving
					an isolated network of auto-provisioned Polycom desk phones (this project ended up costing the company nothing, as we
					were able to fund all related hardware and expenses by selling the obsolete phone system that we replaced); An
					elaborate OpenLDAP corporate directory and central authentication system, using a custom Python web UI for
					administration. These projects and more were entirely my responsibility, from planning and execution to ongoing
					maintenance, uptime and security. I learned a lot and really enjoyed the sense of accomplishment and the wonderful
					esprit de corps that comes with such an environment.</p>

					priority. This also was my responsibility. This involved among other things, encryption of various types of data,
					robust IPsec-based Linux VPN endpoint, router and firewall (internet-facing), and sanitizing large quantities of

				    <p>As a staff-of-one IT department, far into the growth of the organization, automation and centralization was a

					support.) With only a very few exceptions, all solutions were fully free, fully open source projects, all tied
					together to provide a secure, “enterprise” experience, despite financial constraints. This included a
					comprehensive org-wide OpenLDAP deployment, backing various human resources data, providing centralized single
					sign-on, and various other resources (including intranet DNS data.)</p>
