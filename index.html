            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>In 2001, I earned the opportunity to be hired by a Winston-Salem, North Carolina startup called
            &ldquo;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010309030706/http://www.pointdx.com/">PointDx</a>&rdquo;. At
            that point in life, I really didn't have enough life experience to be conscious of the special privilege I
            had been given. I had no comparison; only had mundane, predictable office jobs with low expectations and
            salary to match. What a delight it turned out to be, despite the long hours, to really be a significant
            part of something and to see my efforts put to immediate, practical use. I learned much there, and in the
            other places I've worked, mostly smaller companies of the same type; where things seem to move at a very
            high velocity in high energy environments.</p>

            <p>I have since worked for a wide range of organizations of varying sizes and types, yet what has remained
            unchanged for me is the value I put on accomplishing meaningful things and solving interesting problems
            independent of the obstacles that arise. I value working with a team of humble, capable people who are
            unsatisfied with &ldquo;hacks&rdquo;; people with the wisdom to compromise on a &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo;
            when appropriate, but insist on keeping the ship pointed in the right direction.</p>

            <p>This is the workplace I desire. The details of my technical experiences are available below, on my
            resume. A fair cross-section of my work can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/stnbu">GitHub</a>
            account. I look forward to having further conversations in order to find a match and get to work on
            accomplishing great things!</p>

            <p>Thanks and best wishes.</p>
