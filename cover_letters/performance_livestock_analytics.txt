Greetings.

Please consider me for the role of "Software Engineer" at Performance Livestock Analytics. I have a broad background that includes the success full implementation of multiple production web services, and API, mostly using Django+Python. I have a good amount of PHP experience as well, going back a few years, something I could easily reboot.

I've also got several years' experience working for small, nimble startups, including 2+ years full-time remote work. I bring the WFH discipline.

Please get in touch when you get a chance.

Thanks.
