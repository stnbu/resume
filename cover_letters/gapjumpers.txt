Hello!

Please consider my application for the position of Software Engineer [https://glassdoor.com/]. I have included my resume in MS Word format, but also invite you to view my online resume [https://unintuitive.org/resume/] which offers a bit more detail and interactivity. I have carefully read this position's requirements and think you will agree that there is quite a bit of overlap.

I have been a Python user for 10+ years and have used Python daily as a professional programmer for about six years, most recently in my position as a staff engineer at VMware. I have used Django for numerous projects throughout my career and have recently been brushing up on and polishing my skills by hosting and maintaining some personal web sites:

    • http://hijirishimamoto.com/ (source: https://github.com/stnbu/sws)
    • https://unintuitive.org/ (source: https://github.com/stnbu/oleo)

These are modest websites, but they serve a simple objective. Importantly, they both happen to use exactly the same stack as described in this posting (django+nginix+sql) so these and many other skills are definitely in my "wheelhouse".

I keep busy with plenty of other interesting personal projects. Please feel free to browse my GitHub account [https://github.com/stnbu].

Reading and understanding JavaScript is no problem for me. Writing JavaScript currently requires me to "look at the book" from time to time, but the warm up time is at most a couple of hours, after which I am very productive. I am comfortable with and make heavy use of modern JavaScript development tools and techniques, which makes me yet more productive. I have had occasion in the past to use React.js, Node.js and jQuery, and so am familiar with the "functional" and event-driven nature of modern JavaScript as well. I also have some level of competency in: ruby, rust, scheme, and go.

The first half of my career I spent with small, efficient, start-up-sized organizations. I am familiar with the pace of work and expectations for quality and commitment that come with such an environment. Not only am I familiar and comfortable with such an environment, I’ve found that I prefer it! Meaningful work is the key to a happy work life.

I also have a total of nearly three years of productive work-from-home experience, working for Cisco from my home office in Japan. I was able to effectively communicate with my peers and remain productive despise the distance and time zone difference. Cisco was pleased enough with my work to offer me a promotion and pay for my relocation back to the US, which I accepted. I continued to work for Cisco for another two years. I therefore understand the discipline and boundary-setting essential to succeed while working from home.

I believe that I am a very good candidate for this role! Please get in touch at your earliest convenience.

Thank you.
