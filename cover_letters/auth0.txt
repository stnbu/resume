Hello,

Please consider my application to "Senior Software Engineer, Site Reliability" at Auth0.

I have several years of both energetic, efficient start up and remote-work experience. I prefer to be on top of things, so I have no issues with working independently and producing good results.

I think there is considerable overlap between this posting and my work history. Please feel free to view a range of interesting projects on my github account: https://github.com/stnbu . All of the code in my repos are mine and some of this code is still used regularly by others.

I'm not afraid of some hard work and bring the energy and curiosity.

Please consider getting in touch with me.

Thanks.
