Hello!

I'm interested in being a Python Developer for CoudPoint Systems. I invite you to have a look at my resume https://unintuitive.org/resume/  along with a small cross-section of the kinds of things I've been working on lately: https://unintuitive.org/

I've got the right skills, I believe. I've got plenty of experience working for smaller, start type organizations (and love that environment), and I live in Milpitas, about 15 mins down the road from CloudPoint's Santa Clara address.

Most of my career has centered around Python development. I am new to JS, but have made some strong inroads into learning the modern frameworks/paradigm. It's very interesting and enjoy learning about it.

I'm 90% a "python guy" but genuinely enjoy and am interested in the frontend stuff and am picking it up very fast. I have some recent sample "toy" projects I could share to give a sense of my (current) frontend capabilities.

All the other skills mentioned (git, html5, RDBMS...) I'm very strong with and have years of experience. And much to contribute.

I'd love to have a chat. Please get in touch with me if interested.

Thanks.
