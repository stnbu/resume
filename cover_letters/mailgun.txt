Hi!

Please consider my application for this role (Senior Software Developer). I've looked carefully at the requirements and I think I meet all of them. I consider myself to be a solid python programmer. I have been using python on a daily bases for at least 7 years and have some level of experience going back even further. I'm comfortable with many other languages to varying degrees.

I also have 2+ years of work-from-home experience with Cisco, so I know what it takes, have a positive history, and have the motivation to maintain that privilege.

Have a look at my resume [https://unintuitive.org/resume/] and also my github account: https://github.com/stnbu

Please get in touch if you think I might be a fit.

Thanks.
