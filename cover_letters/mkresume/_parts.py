X_PLEASE_CONSIDER = """Please consider my application for the position of {position}. I have included my resume in MS Word format, but also invite you to view my <<online resume|https://unintuitive.org/resume/>> which offers a bit more detail and interactivity. I have carefully read this position's requirements and think you will agree that there is quite a bit of overlap."""

X_STARTUP = """The first half of my career I spent with small, efficient, start-up-sized organizations. I am familiar with the pace of work and expectations for quality and commitment that come with such an environment. Not only am I familiar and comfortable with such an environment, I’ve found that I prefer it! Meaningful work is the key to a happy work life."""

X_WFH = """I also have a total of nearly three years of productive work-from-home experience, working for Cisco from my home office in Japan. I was able to effectively communicate with my peers and remain productive despise the distance and time zone difference. Cisco was pleased enough with my work to offer me a promotion and pay for my relocation back to the US, which I accepted. I continued to work for Cisco for another two years. I therefore understand the discipline and boundary-setting essential to succeed while working from home."""

X_PYTHON = """I have been a Python user for 10+ years and have used Python daily as a professional programmer for about six years, most recently in my position as a staff engineer at VMware. This role required automation of a range of interactions with different cloud providers and technologies. Much of their tooling and I suspect many of their challenges are similar to those of {company_name} development operations. I also have a passion for quality and efficiency. Time spent "doing it right" is never time misspent."""

X_DJANGO = """I have used Django for numerous projects throughout my career and have recently been brushing up on and polishing my skills by hosting and maintaining some personal web sites:

    • http://hijirishimamoto.com/ (source: https://github.com/stnbu/sws)
    • https://unintuitive.org/ (source: https://github.com/stnbu/oleo)

I keep busy with plenty of other interesting personal projects. Please feel free to browse <<my GitHub account|https://github.com/stnbu>>."""

#X_JAVASCRIPT = """I have used JavaScript off and on throughout my career. It's not as strong as my python, but the more I learn, the more interested I become. I've made some inroads on understanding React and will be updating my personal projects to use React soon. Totally comprehensible."""

X_JAVASCRIPT = """Reading and understanding JavaScript is no problem for me. Writing JavaScript currently requires me to "look at the book" from time to time, but the warm up time is at most a couple of hours, after which I am very productive. I am comfortable with and make heavy use of modern JavaScript development tools and techniques, which makes me yet more productive. I have had occasion in the past to use React.js, Node.js and jQuery, and so am familiar with the "functional" and event-driven nature of modern JavaScript as well."""

X_WEB_BASED_UTILS = """I have also authored some rather complex Flask applications, used by past employers, re-written by hand from scratch for my own purposes:

    • https://github.com/stnbu/dunaway
    • https://github.com/stnbu/centrog"""

X_LINUX = """Up until a few years ago, my every-day machine had been a Linux desktop (first Debian, then Ubuntu, with a smattering of other distributions. I now use a Mac.) No problems getting around and troubleshooting. I am very much at home. I still use Linux daily "on the server side" and have been for years."""

X_SELENIUM = """At VMware I had numerous opportunities to automate testing of the web UI used to drive their <<virtual datacenter product line|https://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws>> using Python's Selenium API."""

#X_GOOD_CODING = """I like readable, efficient, reusable code. I like to think I've learned to strike the right balance. PEP8 is a reasonable starting point. I am a strong believer in all kinds of static code analysis, so pyflakes, etc has been in my toolbox for years."""

X_GOOD_CODING = """I also have a passion for quality and efficiency. Time spent "doing it right" is never time misspent. I believe one should try to write code with the assumption that people WILL read it (so "hacks" are to be avoided) and with reusability as an underlying goal. I do however know how to strike a balance and get that high priority project out the door, postponing beautification for a later time by filing a bug, adding "TODO" comments or setting a milestone."""

X_REST = """On numerous occasions throughout my career I have implemented REST API for projects that I own, mostly using Flask. Most recently, I authored <<a REST-driven "mass host imaging" solution|https://github.com/stnbu/dunaway>> using Flask and a bit of system-related Python logic. This turned out to be a very useful utility for my team and I have since implemented it from scratch for my own purposes."""

#X_GIT = """I'm quite comfortable with git and even make use of its more advanced features from time to time. I both implemented hooks (in Python) and set up a team-use GitLab instance which became popular with the team and was used in place of the IT-administered corporate GitLab (Cisco) due to its speed and our ability to customize."""

X_GIT = """I'm quite comfortable with git and even make use of its more advanced features from time to time. I have implemented hooks (in Python) on many occasions and set up a team-use GitLab instance which became popular with the team and was used in place of the IT-owned corporate GitLab (Cisco) due to its speed, reliability and our ability to customize.
"""

X_PUPPET = """As the sole systems administrator for <<Triad Semiconductor|https://www.triadsemi.com/>> (a team of ~100 people), I used puppet to do basic administration and configuration of 10-15 servers, which involved 2-3 broad server "profiles" (file server, circuit simulation cluster...). Puppet was used to configure the system (Debian Linux), provide regular, automated security updates and to configure various Nagios systems monitoring facilities."""

X_NETWORK = """I am quite familiar with a range of networking concepts, as my career has involved not only implementing networking code in Python but also building out and owning complex networks for multiple employers as a Systems Engineer, in most cases with me being the sole architect, and administrator for businesses ranging from tens to hundreds of employees making heavy use of network resources (e.g. circuit design simulation [Triad Semiconductor] or network security hardware design engineers [Greatwall Systems])."""

X_POSTGRES = """I've had many opportunities over the years to not only use PostgreSQL from the point of view of a programmer (designing queries, being transaction-aware and efficient, using numerous ORMs) but also as an implementer and administrator. I have set up numerous production PostgreSQL instances, being aware of and addressing all of the concerns that come with that: backups, tuning, redundancy, upgrades, data auditing..."""

X_AUTOMATION = """The goal should be to automate everything. It's also important to weigh the cost of automation against other alternatives. I have ample automation experience. My last two positions (a span of 6+ years) centered around automation of a range of hardware and software, most of which was designed without much thought to automation, so I'm familiar with implementing imperfect but GOOD automation for all kinds of things. To give an idea: any and all features of the Cisco UCS product line and much of VMware's cloud datacenter efforts. Rarely does it make sense to think of automation as a "bad", even for an employee that feels their job is under threat: a rising tide raises all boats. We all benefit from automation and it's a good place to focus resources."""

X_LOVE_LEARNING = """Learning is itself an end for me. Learning has mental health benefits. I love learning and it's definitely win-win with regard to employer/employee. When I'm not "working" I'm learning (it's usually both). It keeps me happy and motivated. Among my recent and hopefully marketable interests are: Rust, blockchain, Scheme, Django and JavaScript (the "front end" ecosystem). There's plenty of stuff going on at <<my github account|https://github.com/stnbu>>."""

X_POSTMAN = """I have used Postman, Selenium and a huge amount of custom Python code to automate 'REST' API and web UI interaction for a broad range of devices and SaaS offerings."""
