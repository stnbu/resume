X_PLEASE_CONSIDER = """Please consider my application for the position of {position}. I have attached my resume in MS Word format, but also invite you to view my <<online resume|https://unintuitive.org/static/main/bin/resume-mike-burr.html>> which offers a bit more detail and interactivity."""

X_STARTUP = """The first half of my career I spent with small, efficient, start-up-sized organizations. I am familiar with the pace of work and expectations for quality and commitment that come with such an environment. Not only am I familiar and comfortable with such an environment, I’ve found that I prefer it! Meaningful work is the key to a happy work life."""

X_WFH = """I also have a total of nearly three years of productive work-from-home experience, working for Cisco from my home office in Japan. I was able to effectively communicate with my peers and remain productive despise the distance and time zone difference. Cisco was pleased enough with my work to offer me a promotion and pay for my relocation back to the US, which I accepted. I continued to work for Cisco for another two years. I therefore understand the discipline and boundary-setting essential to succeed while working from home."""

X_PYTHON = """I have been a Python user for 10+ years and have used Python daily as a professional programmer for about six years, most recently in my position as a staff engineer at VMware. This role required automation of a range of interactions with different cloud providers and technologies. Much of their tooling and I suspect many of their challenges are similar to those of {company_name} development operations. I also have a passion for quality and efficiency. Time spent "doing it right" is never time misspent."""

X_DJANGO = """I have used Django for numerous projects throughout my career and have recently been brushing up on and polishing my skills by hosting and maintaining some personal web sites:

    • http://hijirishimamoto.com/ (source: https://github.com/stnbu/sws)
    • https://unintuitive.org/ (source: https://github.com/stnbu/oleo)

I keep busy with plenty of other interesting personal projects. Please feel free to browse <<my GitHub account|https://github.com/stnbu>>."""

X_JAVASCRIPT = """I have used JavaScript off and on throughout my career. It's not as strong as my python, but the more I learn, the more interested I become. I've made some inroads on understanding React and will be updating my personal projects to use React soon. Totally comprehensible."""

X_WEB_BASED_UTILS = """My last two jobs involved work on maintaining and extending very complex testing frameworks, both of which included web UI functionality. Additionally, I've written some utilities DevOps-related utilities with a WebUI. They're no longer maintained, but are worth having a look at:

(The above happen to be written using Flask.)"""

X_LINUX = """Up until a few years ago, my every-day machine had been a linux desktop (first Debian, then Ubuntu, with a smattering of other distros. I now use a Mac.) No problems getting around and troubleshooting. I am very much at home. I still use linux daily "on the server side" and have been for years."""

X_GOOD_CODING = """I like readable, efficient, reusable code. I like to think I've learned to strike the right balance. PEP8 is a reasonable starting point. I am a strong believer in all kinds of static code analysis, so pyflakes, etc has been in my toolbox for years."""
