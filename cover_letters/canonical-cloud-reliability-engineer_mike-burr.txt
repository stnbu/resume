Hello!

I am very interested in the Cloud Reliability Engineer position posted here https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/canonical-cloud-reliability-engineer

I have carefully reviewed the requirements listed in the job posting and I think you will agree that my work history, as detailed in my resume, meshes with them quite neatly.

I have been a Debian user and proponent for more than 15 years and have been very pleased with (but not surprised by) the success of Ubuntu. I have been a Python user for almost as long and have used Python daily as a professional programmer for about six years, most recently in my position as a staff engineer at VMware. This role required automation of a range of interactions with different cloud providers and technologies.

In addition to this, I have almost three years of successful, productive remote-work experience with Cisco. Cisco was pleased enough with their experiences with me offer me a promotion and pay for my relocation to San Jose, California (from Japan). I therefore understand the need for discipline and responsibility that comes with the privilege of a remote-work position and am confident that I can hit the ground running.

I would love to discuss further. Please get in touch with me at your earliest convenience.

Thank you.
