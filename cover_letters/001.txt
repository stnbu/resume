Greetings.

Please consider my application for the role of “Senior Software Engineer (Backend)” as posted here https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/veelo-senior-software-engineer-backend

I have attached my resume in Microsoft Word format, but also invite you to view my resume online here: https://unintuitive.org/resume/ which offers more information and a bit of interactivity. 

The first half of my career I spent with small, efficient, start-up-sized organizations. I am familiar with the pace of work and expectations for quality and commitment that come with such an environment. Not only am I familiar and comfortable with such an environment, I’ve found that I prefer it! Meaningful work is the key to a happy work life.

I also have a total of nearly three years of productive work-from-home experience, working for Cisco from my home office in Japan. I was able to effectively communicate with my peers and remain very productive despise the distance and time zone difference. Cisco was pleased enough with my work to offer me a promotion and pay for my relocation back to the US, which I accepted. I continued to work for Cisco for another two years.

I have used Django for numerous projects throughout my career and have recently been brushing up on and polishing my skills by hosting and maintaining some personal web sites:

    • https://unintuitive.org/ (source: https://github.com/stnbu/oleo)

I keep busy with plenty of other interesting personal projects. Please feel free to browse my GitHub account: https://github.com/stnbu

I’m excited about this position and the prospect of doing meaningful, interesting work with a group of productive, humble, friendly folks!

Please get in touch with me at your convenience.
