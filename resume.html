				<p>I made the conscious decision to leave VMware in June of 2018. I am proud of my contributions, which are many, and
				    am confident I provided value for VMware in excess of my compensation. I am very honest and open about my separation
				    with VMware. It was amicable, orderly and completely voluntary on my part. I’d be happy to have a frank conversation
				    about this if there is a desire for more details. I am confident that VMware is better off for my having been there
				    and I made quite a few friends.</p>

				<p>I am in the process of exploring new opportunities that might involve any number of interesting technologies
				    solving interesting problems. My life satisfaction comes from meaningful work. It is what I crave. I currently divide
				    my time between actively looking for opportunities, skill acquisition and self improvement of any kind.</p>

				VMware
			    </div>

			    <div class="job-summary">

				<p>VMware’s hybrid cloud platform group has a complex, mostly-Python, long-used test framework called “Goat”. My role
				    at VMware was to maintain and extend this framework, along with participation in development of related quality
				    infrastructure and tools (e.g. GitLab). Since this product line is available for a wide range of “cloud providers”
				    (AWS, Rackspace, IBM, and more) as well as custom-built bare metal solutions; accordingly, the range of technologies
				    involved was broad and rapid ramp-up was often required. A typical day might have included: feature implementation,
				    bug resolution, assisting test authors in using framework features, build-out of ancillary tools, CI/CD pipeline
				    features, git hooks, conception and realization of various web portals and custom tools, documentation, meetings and
				    more.</p>

				<p>Along with this came participation in design meetings, Agile meetings, daily stand-up meetings, technical
				    assistance of colleagues and various other in-person interactions to coordinate.</p>

				<p>Solutions and technologies used include: Python, most of its standard libraries, along with a wide range of 3rd
				    party libraries: Django, Flask, Paramiko, Selenium-Python, NumPy and many others; Ruby, including GitLab
				    customizations and extension of existing Ruby infrastructure; Fast, centralized logging via PostgreSQL, Rsyslog and
				    Nginx, combined with a custom Python web UI for centralized logging (Flask).</p>

			    <div class="job-summary">
				<p>Cisco was in need of a robust test framework for their UCS product line. I started in late 2012 on a project that
				    would become known as “Qali”, a pure-Python testing framework that would ultimately become the standard testing
				    framework for the entire business unit, and still is to this day. Qali models the state of the UCS in-memory, using a
				    combination of 1) reading build-related meta information to understand the products’ structure, including possible
				    hardware and configuration combinations and 2) querying the device itself at test-execution-time to understand its
				    state and populate the model. With this information, test authors are able to write very high-level, readable tests
				    describing the desired end-state or the sequence of state changes needed to execute the test in a nice, intuitive,
				    “object oriented” Python syntax reflecting the hierchical structure of the product’s configuration.</p>

				<p>My involvement with Qali and associated projects went from early design and PoC to maintenance and architectural
				    oversight of the entire project years later, after adoption by many hundreds of users spanning several
				    departments.</p>

				Triad Semiconductor

			    <div class="job-summary">
				<p>The infrastructure required to effectively operate a 100+ person team of mixed-signal ASIC design and testing staff
				    is considerable. Outages, performance issues and other problems become very expensive very quickly. The top-to-bottom
				    administration of this environment was my responsibility at Triad Semiconductor. At the time of my hiring, there were
				    numerous problems and inefficiencies that a busy team of design engineers don’t have the time or resources to attend
				    to. I was able to very quickly resolve many of these, leveraging Linux and OSS, a solution not practical without the
				    required domain knowledge.</p>

				<p>All of this worked out nicely, and much of it is still in place now. As good example, when I was hired, multiple
				    bare-metal Red Hat Linux servers were in use for circuit simulation (predominately via Mentor Graphics). There was no
				    reasonable way for engineers to reliably understand current and near-term capacity on these hosts. As a result, it was
				    common for hosts to slow to a crawl due to over-use. I resolved this by consolidating these hosts into a common
				    cluster, one of which was used for storage. I exported this same filesystem over a fast, dedicated network, bonding
				    multiple 10GbE interfaces on each host, deployed Puppet for centralized administration and created a web based (Flask)
				    UI that allowed engineers to see at a glance what utilization was, know what jobs are queued and more effectively
				    anticipate utilization. This amounted to much more efficient use of existing resources. It wasn’t perfect, but was
				    well on its way to being about the best allocation/utilization possible of the available hardware without the need for
				    expensive, proprietary solutions. This is representative of the many other projects that I was involved with, from
				    conception to implementation.</p>

				<p>Some of the other especially fruitful solutions implemented by me include: A fully OSS VPN, using OpenVPN with a
				    custom PKI, allowing for centralized certificate and endpoint management; Replacing costly, proprietary Linux
				    distribution with free, easily maintained Debian variants (mostly Ubuntu); Replacing an expensive, slow, low capacity
				    tape backup system with a centralized over-network, differential, high capacity backup system using hot-swappable
				    commodity eSATA hard disks; Comprehensive site monitoring, including, backup job results, power status, equipment
				    temperatures and humidity using Nagios, Puppet and some custom glue logic; Consolidation and smarter resource
				    utilization using host virtualization (Xen ~ v3.0 at the time).</p>

				Greatwall Systems

			    <div class="job-summary">

				<p>Greatwall Systems was another Wake Forest University spin-off involving many of the same personnel as PointDx. This
				    time I was employee number four. As an information security start-up, Greatwall Systems had special security
				    requirements with regard to both their corporate network and the test network used for product development.</p>

				<p>As the sole Systems Administrator, both of these responsibilities laid with me. All routing, intrusion
				    detection/prevention, email catigorization (spam detection), VPN and firewalling systems were implemented using Debian
				    Linux running on commodity hardware. The development environment, along with various issue tracking and source version
				    control systems were implemented using a heavily customized instance of Trac. Subversion (and later Git, with a
				    transparent migration and no data loss) were employed for version control. As a start-up with a tight budget, all of
				    this was accomplished using fully open-sourced software, deployed, customized and maintained by myself.</p>

				<p>Again, facing budget constraints and a desire to be as efficient and cost-aware as possible, numerous other
				    projects and responsibilities fell to me. Some of the more interesting ones include: Installing Linux on and adding
				    second network interface support for the Sony PlayStation 3 (PS3) for the purposes of developing support for the Cell
				    architecture; A complete IP-telephony system using commodity hardware running Asterisk and later FreeSwitch, driving
				    an isolated network of auto-provisioned Polycom desk phones (this project ended up costing the company nothing, as we
				    were able to fund all related hardware and expenses by selling the obsolete phone system that we replaced); An
				    elaborate OpenLDAP corporate directory and central authentication system, using a custom Python web UI for
				    administration. These projects and more were entirely my responsibility, from planning and execution to ongoing
				    maintenance, uptime and security. I learned a lot and really enjoyed the sense of accomplishment and the wonderful
				    esprit de corps that comes with such an environment.</p>

				<p>At PointDx, A Wake Forest University research spinoff, I quickly learned the value of working with a small, smart,
				    humble team and enjoyed a real sense of accomplishment. Staring as employee number five, I owned all of the IT
				    infrastructure, including voice, and data. As a medical startup, data and infrastructure security was a very high
				    priority. This also was my responsibility. This involved among other things, encryption of various types of data,
				    robust IPsec-based Linux VPN endpoint, router and firewall (internet-facing), and sanitizing large quantities of
				    anonymous radiology (MRI, PET) patient data used in product research and development.</p>

				<p>As a staff-of-one IT department, far into the growth of the organization, automation and centralization was a
				    critical part of maintaining efficiency and scalability. This included automated deployment, update and maintenance of
				    Microsoft Windows-based user workstation infrastructure (including use of Samba’s then brand new Windows Domain
				    support.) With only a very few exceptions, all solutions were fully free, fully open source projects, all tied
				    together to provide a secure, “enterprise” experience, despite financial constraints. This included a
				    comprehensive org-wide OpenLDAP deployment, backing various human resources data, providing centralized single
				    sign-on, and various other resources (including intranet DNS data.)</p>
